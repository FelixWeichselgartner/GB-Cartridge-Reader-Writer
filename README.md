# GB-Cartridge-Reader-Writer

This is an Arduino Shield, that can be used to dump GameBoy cartridges. This project is strongly inspired by this project:

* https://github.com/insidegadgets/GBCartRead

The code in this repo is based on this, however I did a lot of changes to the Arduino code.

The bottom layer is supposed to be wired with a simple wire to be able to use a single layer pcb.
